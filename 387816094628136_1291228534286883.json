I’m so grateful for all the enthusiasm and feedback from the Hackpad community over the last several years, and I’m excited to share what’s coming next.\n\nThat feedback has been really helpful for designing Dropbox Paper—a product inspired by the Hackpad community. With millions of docs created by teams around the world, Paper is off to an exciting start. Paper takes many of Hackpad’s best features—like instant collaboration, comments, and real-time editing—and adds a lot more, including additional security features, faster search, and more visibility for teams.\n\nYou can start using Paper today. I’d love to know what you think.\nhttps:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/paper\n\nYou have a few options for migrating your personal pads from Hackpad.\n\nImport your pads into Paper. I built an importer that helps convert your pads to Paper docs. You’ll need to create an account or sign in to get started.\nhttps:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/login?cont=https%3A%2F%2Fpaper.dropbox.com%2Fhackpad%2F&register_cont=https%3A%2F%2Fpaper.dropbox.com%2Fhackpad%2F\n\nExport your pads. You can export everything into a single zip folder if you’d prefer.\nhttps:\/\/hackpad.com\/ep\/account\/sign-in?cont=https%3A%2F%2Fhackpad.com%2Fep%2Faccount%2Fexport%2F\n\nDo nothing. Your pads will automatically be migrated to Paper on July 19.\n\nOpt out of the automatic migration. Your pads will be deleted on July 19.\nhttps:\/\/hackpad.com\/ep\/account\/sign-in?cont=https%3A%2F%2Fhackpad.com%2Fep%2Faccount%2Fopt-out%2F\n\nFor any workspaces you are a member of, your admin is responsible for importing your team’s Hackpad pads into Paper. If your admin doesn’t take any action, this data will automatically be migrated to Paper on July 19. Once the import is complete, you can sign in to a Dropbox account to join your pads.\nhttps:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/login?cont=https%3A%2F%2Fpaper.dropbox.com%2Fhackpad%2F&register_cont=https%3A%2F%2Fpaper.dropbox.com%2Fhackpad%2F\n\nWhile Paper does not support the Hackpad’s public workspace functionality, you can still create public Paper docs, which can be viewed by non-logged in users. For more details on public Paper docs, you can visit the Help Center.\nhttps:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/help\/9156\n\nI know changes like these can be inconvenient, and I want to help make the transition as smooth as possible. Visit Dropbox to learn more about Paper, or stop by the Help Center for more details about transitioning from Hackpad.\nhttps:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/paper\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to contact us at hackpad@dropbox.com.\n\nIgor Kofman, Hackpad founder and Dropbox Paper lead",
