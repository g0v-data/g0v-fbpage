    "message": "Dear Fellows,\n\nAs I told you before, I'm a French PhD Researcher in Urban Science, actually living in Taipei to write an in-depth case study on my topic: How do inhabitants participate in decision-making on their city transformation ?\n\nPlease find the link to my survey on Taipei City => https:\/\/forms.gle\/3aJPDTainqZHPHyc6. You can also scan the QR code to access it.\n\nI would be very glad if you could fill it and share it with your network.The biggest number of participants will help me to offer the best analyse of decision-making for urban planning in Taipei City.\n\nAll the results of my research will be published (anonymously) on the same blog than my previous and future writings: medium.com\/@julien.carbonnell\n\nIf you want to know more about the theoretical background and the methodology used for this survey, please take a look at \"Theoretical Background: Stakeholder Engagement and Network Science in Urban Studies\" =>http:\/\/bit.ly\/2NqmTN0\n\nIf you want to know more about my global research, please take a look at \"Stakeholder Engagement in Smart-City: Introduction to a comparative analysis of participatory governance in urban complexity\" =>http:\/\/bit.ly\/2P60V4E\n\nBest regards",
