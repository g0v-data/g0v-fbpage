    "message": "Hello, excellent g0v organisers! \n\nThanks for the newsletter today. I have some questions, and other attendees might be interested in as well.\n\n1. I already register as a contributor, but I was wondering whether I have to register each panel talk, workshop because there might be a limitation of participation(seats). \n\n2. Will there be any messenger like Telegram, Slack or FB Messanger to bring all the speakers, attendees and sponsors? I believe all likeminded people want to share their contacts or sudden night-outs. ;) \n\n3. I'm one of the speakers as well, is there any notice and pre-meetups with other speakers before the talk?  \n \n\nCheers,",
