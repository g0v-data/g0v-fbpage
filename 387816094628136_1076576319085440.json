    "message": "g0v你好，月餘前曾透過朋友和g0v聯絡，因有克羅埃西亞的組織希望能夠交流。當時該組織負責人還在國外，最近行程結束返回克國，他很讚賞g0v在台灣的發展，表示會在近期內透過g0v-talks@googlegroups.com 與各位聯絡。\n\n因為不確定可以轉寄給誰，他的email我貼在下面。如果g0v評估後有興趣，或許可以考慮與他的合作，他的email為 futurist.provjereno@gmail.com\n\n謝謝!\n\n-----\n\nDear Rebeca,\n\ngreetings from Croatia that is now entering autumn - temperatures\ndropped to some 17 degrees C, and I could say that after hectic time form return to Croatia up to now, I finally have some time to rest …\n\nThank you, thank you, thank you so much for your really warm\nhospitality, we are mentioning you day by day when speaking to our\nfriends about our tremendous Taiwan experience …\n\nThank you for providing me with links to of the G0V – really it is a\nbig open government organization in Taiwan.\n\nIt's really amazing that they have such a great support with some of\n133.000 followers on its FB page …\n\nWhen analyzing some figures, Taiwan has 5 time more people than\nCroatia, who live on territory that is just 64 percent of Croatian\nterritory.\n\nThe population density in Taiwan is amongst highest in the World – 646 p.\/km2\n\nCroatia has only 76 inhabitants per km2.\n\nThere is also a tendency of leaving Croatia (55.000, mostly young\nprofessionals moved last year to Germany only!), so you may imagine that it is not easy to find a critical amount of qualified people for changes) …\n\nAnyhow, FUTURIST (est. 2005) is trying to do the best to influence\npublic sphere, especially the legislation, but our members are\nvisiting-experts in other countries as well, more about it at:\n\n https:\/\/futuristngo.wordpress.com\/\n\nI was very busy last weeks as I prepare a conference for 400\nparticipants (mostly public information officers) that will take place\nin the Capital Zagreb on 7th of October as the first such a big event\nin supporting the right on accessing the governmental data …\n\nMore about this Congress you could find (but only in Croatian) at\n\nhttps:\/\/prvikongresszihrvatske.wordpress.com\/\n\nIt would be great if there would be chances to cooperate with Taiwan NGOs, so after my conference I will try to reach the G0V via\ng0v-talks@googlegroups.com, or you can also forward or rearange\ninformations from this e-mail for you friends that leads the G0V …\n\nRegarding Watchout I used the on-line translator – so I may read about their activities  in English and Croatian as well about them …\n\nThey also look so promising for future cooperation …\n\nAs Croatia has one of the most liberal Law on the Right to Access\nInformation, the idea is to initiate cooperation of Asian end European experts … G0V maybe have a good insight on tendencies in this regard in Asian countries, and we can provide participants from all of 28 EU-member states, and have the Euro-Asian Forum on Right on Information on the place like this:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.valamar.com\/en\/hotels-dubrovnik\/valamar-lacroma-dubrovnik-hotel\n\nor this one\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=L8PtU6AqP9g\n\nIf there is such an interest I will be glad to start with preparations\nof such Euro-Asian Forum ASAP.\n\nBest regards, with the hope to meet you again ...\n\nNenad",
