    "message": "大家好,\nso this morning I gave a brief presentation on Foodsharing Taiwans foodsaving tool.\nFoodsaving Taiwan is a project to fight food waste in Taiwan by enabling people to p2p share food, by organising cooperations with food retailers to pick up their surplus food and by setting up public fridges all over Taiwan. \nCheck our facebook group here: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/foodsharingtaiwan\nIn Germany all this is organised through a website (www.foodsharing.de), which just exists in german so far. So to give people all over the world the chance to use foodsharing in their countries we are currently working on a international multi-language version: https:\/\/foodsaving.world\/\nopen-source and live coded on github!\nWe are currently looking for developer, programmer and coder who might be willing to contribute and help to save food more efficiently in Taiwan and all over the world in the near future!\nThe Framework we use is Angular JS fronted a django API server\nIf you are interested please get back to me on facebook! \nMany thanks and see you soon!",
